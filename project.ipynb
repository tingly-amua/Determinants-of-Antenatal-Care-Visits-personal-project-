    "### Introduction\n",
    "This report aims to assess the determinants of antenatal care visits using the Poisson and negative binomial regression models. The dependent variable will be antenatal care (ANC) visits which is a count variable. Whereas WHO recommends a minimum of 8 visits, Kenya continues to lag behind with an average of just 4 visits. A statistical analysis of these determinants will highlight which are most impactful thus laying a foundation for accurate and evidence-based recoommendations for policy formulation and improvement of the country's health and specifically maternal sector."
